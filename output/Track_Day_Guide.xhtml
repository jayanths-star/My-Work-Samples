        <h1>A Guide to Track Days</h1>
        <p>PRASANTH</p>
        <p>Contents</p>
        <h1><a id="_bookmark0"/>Purpose of this document</h1>
        <p>This guide is intended for drivers who have limited or no experience of on-track driving.
            It can also be used by intermediate track-day drivers who want to learn something new or
            confirm that they’re heading in the right direction with their circuit driving. To make
            your first track day safe and fun for everyone, it is imperative that you <a href="#_bookmark1">Prepare yourself </a>and <a href="#_bookmark2">Prepare the
                car</a>.</p>
        <h1><a id="_bookmark1"/>Prepare yourself</h1>
        <p>You need to prepare yourself before attending a track day by ensuring that you are ready
            with the following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A valid driving license.</li>
            <li>A crash helmet that complies with the standard British Kite Mark 6658-85 Type A or
                A/FR or SA2000 (since superseded by SA2005 and SA2005-FIA8858).</li>
            <li>Clothing that is overall of fire-proof type or is cotton-based; covers all body
                parts except the hands and face.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Rolled-up sleeves are not allowed while on the circuit.</p>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Do not carry timing equipment on the track day.</p>
        <h1><a id="_bookmark2"/>Prepare the car</h1>
        <p>Driving a car on the circuit puts a far greater strain on it and for much longer than can
            ever be achieved on ordinary roads; therefore, weak points are shown up quickly. You can
            prevent at the outset a few things that cause problems that are found to occur due to
            lack of use or preparation. You can prevent the problems by ensuring the efficiency of
            the following equipment through checks:</p>
        <h2><a id="_bookmark3"/>Fire extinguisher</h2>
        <p>Fire extinguishers installation is a smart idea that can be implemented even if it’s not
            mandatory to do so. Fire suppressant systems can save your car and life in scenarios,
            for example, your car catching fire.</p>
        <h4>To Do</h4>
        <p>Mount a fire extinguisher with a quick release safety strap under the bonnet or in the
            boot or which is tie-wrapped to the seat adjuster. The following table details the
            minimum and recommended requirements for the AFFF extinguishant:</p>
        <table>
            <colgroup>
                <col width="1*"/>
                <col width="1*"/>
                <col width="1*"/>
            </colgroup>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Type of extinguishant</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Minimum quantity</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Recommended quantity</p>
                </td>
            </tr>

                <td>
                    <p>2 litres</p>
                </td>

        <h2><a id="_bookmark4"/>Towing eye</h2>
        <p>The towing eye is used to pull the car up onto a recovery vehicle with a flatbed
            platform. This pulling up is determined by the car’s position and clearance. If the
            slope of the recovery vehicle's ramp is too steep, or if the ground clearance under the
            car is inadequate, then the car may be damaged if you try to pull it up using the towing
            eye.</p>
        <p>If necessary, raise the car by using the recovery vehicle's lifting device. Do not use
            the towing eye.</p>
        <h4>To Do</h4>
        <p>Install screw-in towing eye in the car (if equipped) before arrival at the circuit.
            Inserting towing eye is difficult if the hole is rusty (because of non-usage).</p>

        </p>
        <h2><a id="_bookmark5"/>Brakes</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Figure 2: Towing eye installation</em>
        </p>
        <p>The brakes are a crucial part of your car which helps in avoiding accidents. The brakes’
            significance is highlighted in scenarios in which you are speeding and indulge in
            extreme cornering. Make sure you inspect the brake fluid quality and brake pad thickness
            before arriving on the track day.</p>
        <h3><a id="_bookmark6"/>Fluids</h3>
        <p>It is important to have fresh brake fluid of good quality. Competition brake fluid can be
            used, but some can be more hygroscopic (water absorbing) than others and need
            replacements more often. On the other hand, <strong>ATE dot 4 plus </strong>is more
            effective and is more easily available.</p>
        <p>If the old fluid is left in the system over a while, the heat accumulates in the calipers
            due to the absorption of water. As a result, the moisture comes out of the fluid,
            causing it to become aerated, resulting in the brake pedal going straight to the floor.
            If the heat is allowed to persist for a while, the pedal returns but the fluid needs
            changing. The pedal may get burnt and the brakes then require bleeding after the track
            day. You can generally identify this only when the system is bled and the first couple
            of strokes produce dark-colored brake fluid. If you are anticipating a season of track
            days (and why not), consider the fitment of brake cooling to the front brakes. This is
            the single most effective modification that you can do to help prepare your car for the
            extra loads imposed on the circuit.</p>
        <h3><a id="_bookmark7"/>Pad thickness</h3>
        <p>Ensure that you check the discs for wear and tear - the brake pads should have at least
            half their life left. A certain amount of pad thickness is required to dissipate the
            heat. Standard pads last about five laps before they start to fade; this threshold is
            less on heavy cars, for example, Boxers and Testarossas. The fitment of an improved pad
            designed for fast-road use is desirable. Such pads are available from Mintex, Ferodo,
            and many other suppliers. You should take advice from your preparer regarding these pads
            as new European legislation requires equivalent (to the original pad) replacement pads
            from non-original sources to be ‘E’ marked to conform with homologation</p>
        <p>regulations (not all are ‘E’ marked, yet). The Ferodo DS2000 is ‘E’ marked and is
            advertised as suitable for track day and road use. It is important to bed in the new
            pads correctly; this is usually a simple process for which instructions are included
            with the pads.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2><a id="_bookmark8"/>Seats and seat belts</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Figure 3: New brake vs worn brake</em>
        </p>
        <p>Drivers and passengers must always wear seat belts. It is the driver’s responsibility to
            ensure his/her passenger is strapped correctly. For serious track-day participants, the
            fitment of a four- or six-point safety harness is desirable, and a good racing seat
            provides lateral support and confidence.</p>
        <h2><a id="_bookmark9"/>Tyres</h2>
        <p>The car’s tyres are the only point of contact with the race circuit; therefore, it is
            extremely important that you take care of them and prepare them properly.</p>
        <h3><a id="_bookmark10"/>Pressure</h3>
        <p>Most circuits are clockwise and consequently, the left front tyre takes the most wear and
            tear because the majority of bends are right-handed. If you are running on standard road
            tyres and your car belongs to the pre-348 series, you should check your tyre pressures
            after the first session (after which, most probably, the tyres are hot).</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Pressure should not exceed 35psi.</p>
        <p>The most modern cars, 348, 355, and later series, running on special low-profile tyres,
            should not require pressure adjustment. Remember that any road tyre heats up quite
            quickly and you may suffer a reduction in traction towards the end of a session.</p>
        <h3><a id="_bookmark11"/>Using slicks</h3>
        <p>If you are using slicks, remember that a slick tyre works only in dry or slightly damp
            conditions and that treaded tyres are needed for wet weather. Slicks make the car go
            round the corners faster, but they are not just a bolt-on goodie, the suspension
            settings need to be adjusted. General road suspension is too soft to get the best out of
            them; hence, you also need an extra set of wheels that are to be transported to and from
            circuits. The biggest problem with road tyres is that a circuit tends to wear and tear
            the outside edge of the left front, especially in block-treaded tyres such as Michelin
            XWX and Pirelli P7. Good road and track tyres are Goodyear Eagle F1/F1 Fiorano, Yokohama
            A008, Pirelli P Zero, and Bridgestone Expedia - these have little outside tread but are
            road legal.</p>
